# Create a file named simple_interest.py

# Define the principal amount
principal = 1000

# Define the annual interest rate as a decimal
rate = 0.05

# Define the time in years
time = 3

# Calculate the simple interest using the formula: I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the calculated interest
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
